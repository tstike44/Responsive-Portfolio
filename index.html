                    Hello, my name is Trevor but online I go by trevor_ow. Me being uncreative could
                    not
                    think
                    of a
                    wittier
                    online alias.
                    I currently am unemployed, but previously worked at CVS as a cashier for 3 years followed by
                    another
                    year
                    and a half
                    as a Supervisor. The name trevor_ow comes from my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/trevor_ow"
                        target="_blank">twitch</a>
                    username. I have been streaming (with no real growth)
                    for around 3 years. The goal was never to become a huge streamer but if it happened while just
                    having
                    fun in
                    my free time
                    then I would not complain. Hobbies for me primarily include video games. Recently I
                    became obsessed with Apex Legends.
                    Previous to that I had solely played Overwatch. In my prime I was a steady low master/high
                    diamond
                    off-tank.
                    If I had to pick a hero
                    that would one-trick it will be RoadHog everytime. Nothing is more satisfying than hitting that
                    clutch
                    hook
                    on a flanking tracer/genji.
                    Furthermore, I would like to expand my knowledge in web development and maintain that as my
                    career
                    path.
